### **Description:**  
The notion of a vector space generalizes our familiar experience of three-dimensional space, with its planes and lines, to any dimension. However in higher dimensions our geometric intuition should be supported with the mathematical theory of coordinates. In this course the main objects of study are n-dimensional space, its subspaces, and linear transformations. Our tools are the algebra of matrices and vectors.  
By introducing the notion of an “inner product”, we may also speak of angles and magnitude in any dimension. The importance of linear algebra to mathematics cannot be overstated. Along with calculus, linear algebra is one of the two pillars of mathematics, and is fundamental to any student of science.

### **Learning Outcomes:**  
1. Understanding of concepts of vectors in vector spaces, basis and dimension of a vector space; be able to think about and work out these concepts in examples  
2. Be able to relate a system of linear equations with the range space (/ null space) of the matrix of the system  
3. Be able to translate between the language of functions and matrices for linear transformations; understand the dependence on choice of bases  
4. Be able to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given matrix  
5. Understand inner products, norms, and angles between vectors
