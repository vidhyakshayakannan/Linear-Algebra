### **Description:**  
The notion of a vector space generalizes our familiar experience of three-dimensional space, with its planes and lines, to any dimension. However in higher dimensions our geometric intuition should be supported with the mathematical theory of coordinates. In this course the main objects of study are n-dimensional space, its subspaces, and linear transformations. Our tools are the algebra of matrices and vectors.  
By introducing the notion of an “inner product”, we may also speak of angles and magnitude in any dimension. The importance of linear algebra to mathematics cannot be overstated. Along with calculus, linear algebra is one of the two pillars of mathematics, and is fundamental to any student of science.
